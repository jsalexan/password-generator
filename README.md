# Random Password Generator

## Description

This is a random password generator. The goal of this project was to use JavaScript to bring function to the HTML and CSS provided: a simple form with a "generate password" button and a field for the return. In order to make this work, the following tasks were required:

	1. Create a prompt to collect user choice for password length, between 8 and 128 characters.
	2. Create a series of prompts to collect user choices for character types to include: uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and/or special characters.
	3. Verify that the user's length choice fell within the given parameters and that at least one set of character types had been selected. 
	4. In the event the user's choices do NOT meet the criteria, an alert must be issued so they can make another choice.
	5. A random password, utilizing the user's choices, will be created. 
    6. The password will be written to the form on the webpage for the user to collect.
    7. Ensure that the user could use the form again right away and their previous selections would be cleared.

By meeting these goals, this webpage demonstrates several functions of JavaScript, the form's prompts are clear and simple, and the code is easy to read and understand. I learned more about working with JavaScript, multiple ways to use variables and functions, how to use alerts and prompts, and how to structure the code so it has the correct flow. One challenge was discovering there are multiple ways to achieve one goal, so it was very interesting to attempt to evaluate the best path. I am interested in learning more about this topic and to try creating a more complex generator.

## Credits
The project team consists of the **UW Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp** instructors, teacher assistants, and students, in particular those in the Panic Problems study group. The work was reviewed prior to launch by my tutor, Cory Junier, who assisted in discussing the merits of different solutions and questions about refactoring.
